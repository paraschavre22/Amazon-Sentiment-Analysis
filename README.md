# Amazon-Sentiment-Analysis
Objective: choose a product from https://www.amazon.co.uk/, scrape
product information and at least 200 reviews in order to implement a
sentiment analysis.
• For the product information consider the following instructions:
o Scrape the “Product Details” but not the rank or the number of
customers reviews. Print them.
o Scrape only the number of customers ratings and print it (ex. “200
ratings”).
o Scrape the “Fastest delivery:” date.
• For text mining/sentiment analysis follow these steps:
o Clean the data.
o Provide the visualizations that are more relevant to describe
the data.
o Implement dictionary-based analyses: compare the tidy approach
(all lexicons) with the udpipe one. Compare the differences of the
two approaches. Also discussed the effect of stop-words removal, and
dictionary composition with respect to the context.
